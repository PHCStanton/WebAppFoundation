To integrate an AI agent from n8n into your custom domain, especially as a beginner, it’s essential to follow a structured approach. Since you’re currently running everything locally on localhost, using Visual Studio Code for development, and planning to use Deepseek’s API for the AI agent, I’ll guide you through the process in four phases. Each phase includes four key points to ensure a stable setup with minimal issues and an easy migration to a public host later. I’ll also cover how to create a knowledge base or train the agent on a specific area of expertise. Let’s get started!

---

### **Phase 1: Local Setup**

This phase focuses on ensuring that both your application and n8n are properly set up and can communicate locally.

1. **Confirm n8n is Running Locally**  
   - Since you’ve already run the n8n repository in VS Code, ensure it’s fully operational. By default, n8n runs on `http://localhost:5678`. Open this URL in your browser to verify that the n8n interface loads.  
   - If it doesn’t work, check the terminal in VS Code for errors and ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., run `npm install` if needed).

2. **Set Up Your Custom Domain Locally (Optional)**  
   - You mentioned integrating into a custom domain, but since you’re testing on localhost, you can skip this for now and use `localhost` directly. However, if you want to simulate a custom domain (e.g., `mydomain.local`), edit your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) to map `127.0.0.1` to `mydomain.local`.  
   - Example entry: `127.0.0.1 mydomain.local`. Save the file and test by visiting `http://mydomain.local:5678` in your browser.

3. **Ensure Communication Between Your Application and n8n**  
   - With both your application and n8n running locally, your application can reach n8n at `http://localhost:5678`. No complex setup is needed since they’re on the same machine.  
   - If you use a custom domain later, you could set up a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx), but for simplicity as a beginner, stick with `localhost` for now.

4. **Test the Communication**  
   - In n8n, create a test workflow (e.g., a Webhook node that returns a simple message like “Hello!”). Activate it and note the webhook URL.  
   - Use a tool like Postman or a command like `curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/your-id` to send a request and confirm you get a response. This ensures n8n is ready to integrate.

### **Phase 2: Create the n8n Workflow with Deepseek’s API**

Here, you’ll build a workflow in n8n that uses Deepseek’s API to power your AI agent.

1. **Set Up Deepseek Credentials in n8n**  
   - Sign up for a Deepseek account at their website and get your API key from your account dashboard.  
   - In n8n, go to **Credentials** > **Add Credential**, select “Deepseek API” (or a generic HTTP/API option if Deepseek isn’t listed), enter your API key, and save it.

2. **Create a New Workflow with a Trigger**  
   - Open n8n’s workflow editor and click **+ New** to start a workflow.  
   - Add a **Webhook** node as the trigger. Set it to respond to POST requests. This allows your application to activate the workflow by sending data.

3. **Add the AI Agent Node Using Deepseek**  
   - Drag an **AI Agent** node into the workflow and connect it to the Webhook node.  
   - In the node settings, select Deepseek as the model, link it to your saved credential, and configure the prompt (e.g., “Answer this: {{input}}”). Test with a simple input to ensure it connects to Deepseek’s API.

4. **Configure the Workflow to Return the AI’s Response**  
   - Add a **Respond to Webhook** node and connect it to the AI Agent node.  
   - Set it to return the AI’s output (e.g., `{{ $node["AI Agent"].json["output"] }}`). Save and activate the workflow. Copy the webhook URL for the next phase.

---

### **Phase 3: Integrate the n8n Workflow with Your Application**

Now, connect your application to the n8n workflow so it can use the AI agent.

1. **Get the Webhook URL from n8n**  
   - In the Webhook node’s settings, find the “Production” URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5678/webhook/your-id`). This is what your application will call.  
   - Test it manually with Postman to ensure it works before coding.

2. **Make an HTTP Request from Your Application**  
   - In your application’s code (e.g., JavaScript in VS Code), use a library like `axios` or `fetch` to send a POST request to the webhook URL. Example with `fetch`:  
     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5678/webhook/your-id', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ input: 'Hello, AI!' })
     });
     const data = await response.json();
     ```
   - Adjust the `body` to send whatever input your AI agent needs.

3. **Handle the Response in Your Application**  
   - Process the response from n8n (e.g., `data.output`) and display it in your application (e.g., update the UI or log it).  
   - Example: `console.log(data.output)` or update a webpage element.

4. **Test the Integration**  
   - Run your application and trigger the request (e.g., via a button click). Check that the AI’s response appears as expected.  
   - Debug any issues by checking VS Code’s terminal for errors or n8n’s workflow execution log.

### **Phase 4: Add a Knowledge Base (Optional)**

To enhance your AI agent’s expertise in a specific area, add a simple knowledge base. This is optional but improves accuracy.

1. **Create a Simple Knowledge Base**  
   - Use Google Sheets to create a basic database. For example, Column A: “Question/Keyword,” Column B: “Answer/Details.” Fill it with info relevant to your expertise area (e.g., tech FAQs).  
   - Make the sheet public or generate an API key for access if needed.

2. **Add a Node to Query the Knowledge Base in n8n**  
   - In your workflow, add a **Google Sheets** node between the Webhook and AI Agent nodes.  
   - Configure it to search the sheet based on the webhook input (e.g., look up a keyword in Column A and return Column B). Test it with sample data.

3. **Pass the Retrieved Information to the AI Agent**  
   - Connect the Google Sheets node to the AI Agent node. Update the AI Agent’s prompt to include the retrieved data, like:  
     ```
     Based on this info: {{ $node["Google Sheets"].json["value"] }}, answer: {{ $node["Webhook"].json["input"] }}
     ```
   - This gives the AI context to work with.

4. **Test the Enhanced Workflow**  
   - Send a test request via your application that matches a keyword in your sheet. Verify the AI uses the sheet’s info in its response.  
   - Tweak the prompt or sheet data if the answers aren’t precise enough.

### **Migrating to a Public Host**

When you’re ready to go online, here’s how to transition smoothly:

1. **Host Your Application**  
   - Deploy your app to a service like Heroku, Vercel, or a VPS. Assign it a public domain (e.g., `myapp.com`).  
   - Update any hardcoded `localhost` references to the new domain.

2. **Host n8n**  
   - Use n8n Cloud (easiest for beginners, with a free trial) or self-host on a VPS (follow n8n’s installation guide).  
   - Get the new public webhook URL from your hosted n8n instance.

3. **Update the Integration**  
   - In your application, replace the local webhook URL with the public one (e.g., `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-id`).  
   - Test the connection over the internet.

4. **Secure Your Setup**  
   - Store your Deepseek API key in environment variables (e.g., `.env` file) instead of hardcoding it.  
   - If self-hosting n8n, enable authentication for webhooks in n8n’s settings for added security.

### **Key Considerations and Tips**

- **Stability**: Test each phase thoroughly before moving on. Use VS Code’s debugging tools and n8n’s execution logs to catch errors early.  
- **Simplicity**: Stick to localhost for now to avoid proxy/domain complexity. Add those later when you’re comfortable.  
- **Deepseek API**: Check Deepseek’s docs for model options and prompt tips to optimize your agent’s performance.  
- **Knowledge Base**: Start with a Google Sheet for ease. Later, explore local vector databases like ChromaDB if you need more power.  
- **Resources**: Dive into n8n’s [AI workflow tutorials](https://n8n.io/docs) and Deepseek’s API docs for deeper learning.

By following these phases, you’ll have a stable, locally running AI agent integrated into your application, with a clear path to going public. Take it step-by-step, and you’ll get there—good luck!
